# SyncSim

This code simulates the synchrotron emission from an expanding blob of electrons and magnetic field.
The code allows you to input real physical parameters (energy, initial size, expansion speed, source distance) and then will calculate the light curve at three user-defined frequencies.

Light curves are produced, output and plotted. A large number of other variables (size, solid angle, optical depth etc) are also plot-able and exportable.
Code them analyses the light curves to identify the peaks and the simulation physical conditions associated with them.

The output format will be used as input to other modules soon to arrive.
